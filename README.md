### Manual Installation

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration**
3. Search for "Delaware OH Refuse Schedule"
4. Enter your Delaware, Ohio street address (e.g., "1 Sandusky St")

The integration will:
- Look up your collection day using Delaware County's map
- Download and parse the current holiday schedule
- Create a calendar entity with your collection schedule

### Configuration Options

- **Address**: Your street address in Delaware, Ohio
- **Update Interval**: How often to check for schedule updates (1-365 days, default: 90)

## Usage

Once configured, you'll have a calendar entity named "Refuse Schedule - [Your Address]" that shows:

- **Trash & Recycling Collection**: Weekly events on your collection day
- **Holiday Adjustments**: Automatically moved dates when holidays affect collection

### Entity ID Format

The calendar entity ID is based on your address:
- Format: `calendar.delawareoh_refuse_[sanitized_address]`
- Example: `calendar.delawareoh_refuse_1_sandusky_st`

### Calendar Entity Usage

The calendar entity can be used in:

- **Calendar Cards**: Display upcoming collections in your dashboard
- **Automations**: Trigger reminders or actions before collection day
- **Google Calendar Sync**: Sync to external calendars
- **Mobile App**: View collection schedule on your phone

### Example Automation

Get a reminder the night before trash collection:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Trash Collection Reminder"
    trigger:
      - platform: calendar
        entity_id: calendar.delawareoh_refuse_1_sandusky_st
        event: start
        offset: "-18:00:00"  # 18 hours before (6pm day before)
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Trash Collection Tomorrow"
          message: "Don't forget to put out the trash tonight!"
```

## Holiday Adjustments

The integration automatically handles Delaware's holiday schedule:

- **Memorial Day** (Monday): All collections shift forward one day
- **Independence Day** (Friday): Friday collection moves to Saturday
- **Labor Day** (Monday): All collections shift forward one day
- **Thanksgiving** (Thursday): Thursday→Friday, Friday→Saturday
- **Christmas** (Thursday): Thursday→Friday, Friday→Saturday
- **New Year's Day** (Thursday): Thursday→Friday, Friday→Saturday

When holidays affect your collection day, the calendar automatically shows the adjusted date.
